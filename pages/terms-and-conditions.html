       <div class="text-left">
         <p class="text-left">Please read the terms and conditions stated below, in order to proceed with your MB Superb Logistics auto transport order.</p>
         <p class="text-left">MB Superb Logistics, LLC (“MB Superb Logistics”) is a fully licensed and bonded auto transport broker (USDOT broker license # 4262895). These Terms and Conditions (the “Agreement”) govern the Services (as defined in this Agreement) provided by MB Superb Logistics to you, as the customer (together with your designees, referred to herein as “Customer”, “you”, or “your”).</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Customer is the registered legal owner of the vehicle(s) and has authority to enter into this Agreement or has been duly authorized by the legal owner of the vehicle(s) to enter into this Agreement</li>
            <li>Customer shall prepare the vehicle(s) for transport by removing or properly securing all batteries, loose parts, fragile or protruding accessories, racks, antennas and other similar items. The Customer shall disarm any vehicle alarm system and provide MB Superb Logistics with any tools or keys necessary to disarm the system, if activated. If the alarm system is activated during the transport of the vehicle, the Carrier may deactivate the alarm system by any means that it deems reasonable and effective. Customer releases any claims for damages that are caused by Customer's failure to fulfill these obligations.</li>
            <li>Customer shall remove all detachable personal belongings from the vehicle(s). The Carrier may impose additional fees, in its sole discretion, for the transport of contents left in a vehicle. In no event, however, will MB Superb Logistics be responsible for the safe transport of any such contents.</li>
            <li>Customer or his/her designee, who has been identified to MB Superb Logistics, shall be present at the point of pick-up or delivery. If Customer or its authorized designee is not present for any reason, the vehicle(s) will be placed in storage, at Customer's cost.</li>
            <li>All delivery dates and times are only estimates. MB Superb Logistics does not agree to transport the vehicle(s) in a specific time frame for any particular market or event and will not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from any delay. NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO DELIVERY TIMES OR DATES.</li>
            <li>MB Superb Logistics engages with Carriers to transport vehicles at their discretion. Such Carriers are required to have adequate insurance coverage and to provide proof of such insurance to MB Superb Logistics. Their insurance coverage is primary and is responsible for payment of any claims for loss or damage incurred while the vehicle is in their custody and control. In the event of damages incurred while vehicle is in the care of said Carrier, all resulting claims must be directed to the company who physically delivered the vehicle and not MB Superb Logistics. As a courtesy to our customers, MB Superb Logistics will, as necessary, act as agent in the claims process in order to facilitate expedient result.</li>
            <li>If vehicle is vandalized either during transport, carrier will not be held responsible: owner will have to submit a claim to his/her own insurance or absorb the loss. Customer agrees that his/her vehicle is insured and his/her insurance has primary responsibility.</li>
            <li>Nothing in this agreement binds carrier to pick up and/or deliver to locations from which it is impractical to operate carrier's equipment because of inadequacies of highway, street, and passageways for loading or unloading, local, state or federal law. Customer authorizes the Carrier to drive, park, store, and otherwise operate or transport the vehicle(s) in any manner necessary to fulfill the obligations under this Agreement. Customer shall maintain insurance on the vehicle that shall extend to Carrier’s operation of the vehicle. IN NO EVENT SHALL CARRIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES TO VEHICLES ACTUALLY TRANSPORTED AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES WERE CAUSED BY CARRIERS’ GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL CONDUCT.</li>
            <li>Customer shall identify any damage to any vehicle(s) by noting the damage on the Bill of Lading received by Customer at the time of delivery. Any claims related to such noted damage must be submitted in writing to MB Superb Logistics or Carrier within 15 days of delivery, or, in case of failure of delivery, within 15 days of the date that vehicle was scheduled to be delivered. Customer hereby waives any damage claims that are not noted on the Bill of Lading or for which Customer has not submitted a timely written claim.</li>
            <li>In the event that customer and/or its designee initiates a termination of services after the vehicle has been assigned to a Carrier for pick up (dispatched), MB Superb Logistics reserves the right to charge customer and/or its agent a fee for partial services rendered and to cover administration costs.</li>
            <li>Customer and/or its designee are jointly and severally liable for any and all unpaid charges including, but not limited to sums advanced or disbursed by MB Superb Logistics or Carrier and any and all cost of collection, including costs and reasonable attorney fees.</li>
            <li>Performance under this contract shall be excused to the extent such performance is prevented by force majeure.</li>
            <li>The provisions of this Agreement are severable and the invalidity and enforceability of any provisions herein shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions which shall remain in full force and effect.</li>
            <li>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with laws of the state of Texas. The parties further agree that any legal action arising out of this Agreement shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction within Katy, Texas.</li>
