Shipping a vehicle should feel easy, not confusing. Here’s the step-by-step process:

### **1. Request a Quote**

You provide basic details:

*   Pickup and drop-off location


  Vehicle type


  Condition (running/non-running)


  Preferred shipping dates



We send a clear, all-inclusive quote.




### **2. Reserve Your Spot**

If the quote works, we place your shipment on our nationwide load board and match it with a trusted, highly rated carrier.




### **3. Carrier Assignment**

We notify you once your carrier is assigned. You receive:

*   Driver’s name


  Phone number


  Carrier company info


  Estimated pickup window





### **4. Pickup Day**

The driver contacts you 2–4 hours before arrival.

During pickup, they inspect the vehicle and mark everything on the Bill of Lading.




### **5. Transport Begins**

Your vehicle is transported safely using an open or enclosed carrier. You receive updates during the trip.




### **6. Delivery Day**

Upon arrival, the driver inspects the vehicle again and confirms everything matches the pickup condition.

Then you pay the remaining balance **directly to the carrier**.





### **That’s it. Stress-free. Clear. Professional.**
